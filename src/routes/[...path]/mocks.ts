export const markdown = `# gRPC

gRPC is a way to interface between two nodes over HTTP using a binary format
similar to JSON, but not self-documenting. The schema for this interaction is
defined using protobufs. This technology came out of Google and was originally
called "Google Remote Procedure Call", but is now usually "General RPC".
